# FreeCodeCamp JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures(Beta) - Certification Projects

This repository contains the certification projects completed as part of the **JavaScript Algorithms and Data Structures** course on FreeCodeCamp. These projects demonstrate my proficiency in solving real-world problems using JavaScript and mastering key concepts such as algorithms, data structures, and coding best practices.

## Projects Included

1. **Palindrome Checker**  
   Verify whether a given string is a palindrome by implementing a robust algorithm.  

2. **Roman Numeral Converter**  
   Convert decimal numbers to their Roman numeral representations.  


## Technologies Used

- **JavaScript (ES6)**: Core programming language used to build and test all projects.
- **Algorithm Design**: Emphasis on designing and optimizing algorithms for efficient problem-solving.
- **Regular Expressions**: Extensive use in string validation and pattern matching.
- **Functional Programming**: Leveraging functional paradigms for concise and modular code.
